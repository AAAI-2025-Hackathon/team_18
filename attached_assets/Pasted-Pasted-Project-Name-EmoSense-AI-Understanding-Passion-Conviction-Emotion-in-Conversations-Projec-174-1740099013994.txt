Project Name:
ðŸ§  "EmoSense AI: Understanding Passion, Conviction & Emotion in Conversations"

Project Goal:
Build an emotionally intelligent AI assistant that goes beyond sentiment analysis and surface-level empathy to recognize intensity, progression, dissonance, conviction, and authenticity in text, voice, and facial expressions.

Key Capabilities of EmoSense AI
Emotional Arc Mapping:

Detects how emotions evolve over a conversation.
Identifies turning points where frustration turns into determination, or excitement turns into concern.
Emotional Intensity Spectrum:

Classifies how strong an emotion is (e.g., mild irritation â†’ burning rage).
Tracks escalation points in speech, text, and facial expressions.
Conviction & Passion Detection:

Scores how strongly someone believes in what they are saying.
Differentiates casual statements from deeply held convictions.
Emotional Dissonance Detection:

Detects when someone's words donâ€™t match their emotions.
Identifies masked emotions in text and voice.
Multimodal Emotion Analysis:

Text Analysis: Detects emotions and passion markers in messages.
Voice Analysis: Captures tone shifts, hesitation, conviction from speech.
Facial Recognition: Analyzes expressions to validate emotional authenticity.
Technology Stack
Text Understanding: Llama 3, GPT-4, Mistral
Voice Emotion Analysis: OpenAI Whisper, SpeechBrain, Praat
Facial Emotion Recognition: OpenCV, DeepFace, Affectiva
Visualization & Frontend: Streamlit / React
Deployment: FastAPI + Hugging Face / Flask
Finding Relevant Datasets
We need datasets that contain text, voice, and facial expressions with emotional labels.

Text Emotion Analysis Datasets:

GoEmotions (Google): 58k Reddit comments labeled with 27 emotions.
SEMEVAL 2018 Task 1: Emotion intensity detection dataset.
EmpatheticDialogues (Facebook AI): Conversations labeled for empathy.
Speech Emotion Recognition Datasets:

RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song): High-quality audio clips with emotions.
CREMA-D: 7,442 audio clips from 91 actors labeled for emotion intensity.
MELD (Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset): Conversations with text, audio, and facial expressions.
Facial Emotion Recognition Datasets:

FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition): 35,000 facial images labeled with emotions.
AffectNet: 1M+ images with 8 emotional labels.
EmoReact Dataset: Annotated videos for emotion detection.
Implementation Plan
Hereâ€™s the Python code for a basic prototype that integrates text emotion detection, voice analysis, and facial expression recognition into a conversational agent.

Emosense Ai

Answer in chat instead
This prototype combines text emotion analysis, voice emotion recognition, and facial expression analysis into an emotion-aware AI that can understand passion, conviction, and emotional intensity.

Next Steps: Making This Actionable
Hereâ€™s how this can be integrated into real-life use cases:

Personal Emotional Journaling App

Users record their voice/text entries, and EmoSense AI provides insights into emotional trends over time.
Emotionally Aware Virtual Assistant

Helps detect emotional changes and adjusts responses accordingly.
Customer Support & Leadership Insights

Identifies hidden frustration, conviction, or tension in conversations.
AI-Powered Therapy / Mental Wellness Companion

Helps users recognize emotional progression, intensity shifts, and inner conflicts.
This is a first-of-its-kind emotional intelligence engine for AI that could redefine how AI understands human passion & emotions. ðŸš€
